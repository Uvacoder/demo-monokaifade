Hippotas, dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it
were) upon the sea, {83} iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,
Aeolus has six daughters and six lusty sons, so he made the sons marry
the daughters, and they all live with their dear father and mother,
feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long the
atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats till
it groans again, yard and all; but by night they sleep on their well
made bedsteads, each with his own wife between the blankets. These were
the people among whom we had now come. "Aeolus entertained me for a
whole month asking me questions all the time about Troy, the Argive
fleet, and the return of the Achaeans. I told him exactly how everything
had happened, and when I said I must go, and asked him to further me on
my way, he made no sort of difficulty, but set about doing so at once.
Moreover, he flayed me a prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring
winds, which he shut up in the hide as in a sack--for Jove had made him
captain over the winds, and he could stir or still each one of them
according to his own pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the
mouth so tightly with a silver thread that not even a breath of a
side-wind could blow from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for
us did he alone let blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing, for we
were lost through our own folly. "Nine days and nine nights did we sail,
and on the tenth day our native land showed on the horizon. We got so
close in that we could see the stubble fires burning, and I, being then
dead beat, fell into a light sleep, for I had never let the rudder out
of my own hands, that we might get home the faster. On this the men fell
to talking among themselves, and said I was bringing back gold and
silver in the sack that Aeolus had given me. 'Bless my heart,' would one
turn to his neighbour, saying, 'how this man gets honoured and makes
friends to whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he
is taking home from Troy, while we, who have travelled just as far as he
has, come back with hands as empty as we set out with--and now Aeolus
has given him ever so much more. Quick--let us see what it all is, and
how much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.' "Thus they
talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack, whereupon the
wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried us weeping out
to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke, and knew not whether
to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make the best of it; but
I bore it, covered myself up, and lay down in the ship, while the men
lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our fleet back to the Aeolian
island. "When we reached it we went ashore to take in water, and dined
hard by the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of
my men and went straight to the house of Aeolus, where I found him
feasting with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the
threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said, 'Ulysses, what
brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great pains
to further you on your way home to Ithaca, or wherever it was that you
wanted to go to.' "Thus did they speak, but I answered sorrowfully, 'My
men have undone me; they, and cruel sleep, have ruined me. My friends,
mend me this mischief, for you can if you will.' "I spoke as movingly as
I could, but they said nothing, till their father answered, 'Vilest of
mankind, get you gone at once out of the island; him whom heaven hates
will I in no wise help. Be off, for you come here as one abhorred of
heaven.' And with these words he sent me sorrowing from his door.
"Thence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and
fruitless rowing, for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six
days, night and day did we toil, and on the seventh day we reached the
rocky stronghold of Lamus--Telepylus, the city of the Laestrygonians,
where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]
salutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last answers
the salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep might earn
double wages, one as a herdsman of cattle, and another as a shepherd,
for they work much the same by night as they do by day. {84}
"When we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep cliffs,
with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took all their
ships inside, and made them fast close to one another, for there was
never so much as a breath of wind inside, but it was always dead calm. I
kept my own ship outside, and moored it to a rock at the very end of the
point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre, but could see no sign
neither of man nor cattle, only some smoke rising from the ground. So I
sent two of my company with an attendant to find out what sort of people
the inhabitants were. "The men when they got on shore followed a level
road by which the people draw their firewood from the mountains into the
town, till presently they met a young woman who had come outside to
fetch water, and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates.
She was going to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in
their water, and when my men had come close up to her, they asked her
who the king of that country might be, and over what kind of people he
ruled; so she directed them to her father's house, but when they got
there they found his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain, and
they were horrified at the sight of her. "She at once called her husband
Antiphates from the place of assembly, and forthwith he set about
killing my men. He snatched up one of them, and began to make his dinner
off him then and there, whereon the other two ran back to the ships as
fast as ever they could. But Antiphates raised a hue-and-cry after them,
and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians sprang up from every
quarter--ogres, not men. They threw vast rocks at us from the cliffs as
though they had been mere stones, and I heard the horrid sound of the
ships crunching up against one another, and the death cries of my men,
as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes and took them home to eat
them. While they were thus killing my men within the harbour I drew my
sword, cut the cable of my own ship, and told my men to row with all
their might if they too would not fare like the rest; so they laid out
for their lives, and we were thankful enough when we got into open water
out of reach of the rocks they hurled at us. As for the others there was
not one of them left. "Thence we sailed sadly on, glad to have escaped
death, though we had lost our comrades, and came to the Aeaean island,
where Circe lives--a great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the
magician Aeetes--for they are both children of the sun by Perse, who is
daughter to Oceanus. We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a
word, for some god guided us thither, and having landed we lay there for
two days and two nights, worn out in body and mind. When the morning of
the third day came I took my spear and my sword, and went away from the
ship to reconnoitre, and see if I could discover signs of human
handiwork, or hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high
look-out I espied the smoke of Circe's house rising upwards amid a dense
forest of trees, and when I saw this I doubted whether, having seen the
smoke, I would not go on at once and find out more, but in the end I
deemed it best to go back to the ship, give the men their dinners, and
send some of them instead of going myself. "When I had nearly got back
to the ship some god took pity upon my solitude, and sent a fine
antlered stag right into the middle of my path. He was coming down his
pasture in the forest to drink of the river, for the heat of the sun
drove him, and as he passed I struck him in the middle of the back; the
bronze point of the spear went clean through him, and he lay groaning in
the dust until the life went out of him. Then I set my foot upon him,
drew my spear from the wound, and laid it down; I also gathered rough
grass and rushes and twisted them into a fathom or so of good stout
rope, with which I bound the four feet of the noble creature together;
having so done I hung him round my neck and walked back to the ship
leaning upon my spear, for the stag was much too big for me to be able
to carry him on my shoulder, steadying him with one hand. As I threw him
down in front of the ship, I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by
man to each of them. 'Look here my friends,' said I, 'we are not going
to die so much before our time after all, and at any rate we will not
starve so long as we have got something to eat and drink on board.' On
this they uncovered their heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag,
for he was indeed a splendid fellow. Then, when they had feasted their
eyes upon him sufficiently, they washed their hands and began to cook
him for dinner. "Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the
sun we stayed there eating and drinking our fill, but when the sun went
down and it came on dark, we camped upon the sea shore. When the child
of morning, rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared, I called a council and said,
'My friends, we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me.
We have no idea where the sun either sets or rises, {85} so that we do
not even know East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless, we
must try and find one. We are certainly on an island, for I went as high
as I could this morning, and saw the sea reaching all round it to the
horizon; it lies low, but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out
of a thick forest of trees.'`
